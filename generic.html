              <i>"I heard about a Samarth high school in Valsad, where students had to pass
              a certain number of courses to graduate, and if they didn’t pass a
              course, they got the grade “Not Yet”. And I thought that was
              fantastic, because if you get a failing grade, you think, I’m
              nothing, I’m nowhere. But if you get the grade “Not Yet” you
              understand that you’re on a learning curve. It gives you a path
              into the future. “Not Yet” also gave me insight into a critical
              event early in my career, a real turning point. I wanted to see
              how children coped with challenge and difficulty, so I gave
              10-year-olds problems that were slightly too hard for them. Some
              of them reacted in a shockingly positive way. They said things
              like, “I love a challenge” or “You know, I was hoping this would
              be informative”. They understood that their abilities could be
              developed. They had what I call a growth mindset. But other
              students felt it was tragic, catastrophic. From their more fixed
              mindset perspective, their intelligence had been up for judgment
              and they failed. Instead of luxuriating in the power of yet, they
              were gripped in the tyranny of now. So what do they do next? I’ll
              tell you what they do next. In one study, they told us they would
              probably cheat the next time instead of studying more if they
              failed a test. In another study, after a failure, they looked for
              someone who did worse than they did so they could feel really good
              about themselves. And in study after study, they have run from
              difficulty. Scientists measured the electrical activity from the
              brain as students confronted an error. On the left, you see the
              fixed mindset students. There’s hardly any activity. They run from
              the error. They don’t engage with it. But on the right, you have
              the students with the growth mindset, the idea that abilities can
              be developed. They engage deeply. Their brain is on fire with yet.
              They engage deeply. They process the error. They learn from it and
              they correct it."</i> <b> - Smeet G8</b>

                  One of the most interesting stages in life that gives you an
                  opportunity to explore is the ‘college phase’. Life at college
                  is the time when the teenage years end and we all dive deep
                  into the ocean of new beginnings and possibilities. This
                  golden period better equips you for all the challenges you’ll
                  face in life and creates a strong foundation of knowledge.

                  Bhakti International School presented unprecedented scale and
                  diversity of opportunity. My two years of phenomenal teachers
                  across the disciplines pushed me to expand, challenge, and
                  adjust my worldview. My experience of self learning with
                  classmate showed me the power of empathetic leadership and
                  expanded my artistic comfort zone. My tenure throwing major,
                  campus-wide events validated that quality stems from attention
                  to detail. My engagement in BIS's tech & innovation
                  initiatives exercised my creative muscle, sparked my obsession
                  with design, and strengthened my tolerance to adversity. My
                  internships at
                  <a href="https://www.wipro.com/"> <b>wipro</b> </a> and
                  <a href="https://www.arista.com/en/"> <b>Arista</b> </a> and
                  invest money and value in online courses helped me discover my
                  love for building products that make people's lives better.
                  BIS showed me what I love to do, gifted me with a love for
                  learning, and surrounded me with a wealth of inspiring peers.
